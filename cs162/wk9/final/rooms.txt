<ROOM 1>
You wake up in your cabin to the blaring sound of a siren. This can't be good. 
This only happens when there is a really emergency. You quickly put on all your 
gear. Time to head to your post. The door to the south leads to the ship's hallway.     
</ROOM 1>
<ROOM 2>
As you stumble out of your room you realize that the situation is far worse
than you initially thought. There should be crew members running to their
posts however; the ship is completely empty. The hallway is lite only by the
emergency lights.  
</ROOM 2>
<ROOM 3>
As you move further down the hallway you are startled to hear..."SELF DESTRUCTION 
SEQUENCE INITIATED. THE SHIP WILL SELF DESTRUCT IN 10 MINUTES." This situation 
just went from bad to worse. You've got to get off this ship... and fast. You 
need to get to the escape pods. It won't be a walk in the park though. You need 
to find the access code to the escape pod's door.

If your memory serves you right it should be in the captains cabin. He's
probably got his cabin locked so you'll have to track down his key card.  
</ROOM 3>
<ROOM 4>
You keep moving down the hallway keeping your hand close to the wall to guide
you through the darkness. You now have a choice. You can continue down the
hallway or explore the messhall. 
</ROOM 4>
<ROOM 5>
There looks like there was a large struggle in the messhall. Tables and cars
have been overturn and blood stains the floor and walls. You walk into the
kitchen and find the captains body. Looks like he didn't go without a fight.
You look in his jacket and find his keycard. 
</ROOM 5>
<ROOM 6>
You keep moving down the hallway. Looks like there's more light ahead. You
remember that both the captains cabin and escape pod should be this way.
</ROOM 6>
<ROOM 7>
You reach the end of the hallway. To your north is the captains cabin. The
door is closed. You will need some type of key card to open it. To the east is
the escape pod but you will need a keycard to open it.
</ROOM 7>
<ROOM 8>
After you open the door you quickly rush into the captains cabin and start to
search for the code. After some time you find it written on a piece of paper 
in the drawer in his desk. 

It reads '1234'. Wow! The captain was really creative with his passwords.
</ROOM 8>
<ROOM 9>
You're almost in the clear. The escape pods are in front of you. There is a
keypad to enter a passcode.
</ROOM 9>
<ROOM 10>
You open up the pod and jump in. You punch in the coordinates and are on your
way to from the starship.

As your escape pod travels through space the starship explodes to magnificent
silence behind you.
</ROOM 10>
